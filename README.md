Data Analysis Using Python Pandas For A Super Store 
Sales Analysis for a Super Store Using Python Pandas<Br>
In this analysis using Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions.<br> 
About 4 years worth of sales data, this data contains hundreds of thousands of various items store purchases broken down by categories and subcategories, ship mode, sales, profit, quantity, etc.<br>
On this journey I went from Curating the data, to asking important Business Questions and then analysing the dataset to deduct essential Insights for Business Decisons making.<br>

The Process inludes:<br>
 A.  DATA CLEANING.<br>
In this stage, the tasks are:
1.  To identify Nan rows   
2.  To Drop NaN values from DataFrame

<h4>Next Stage:<br>
B.  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) <br>
In this section, important business questions related to the data were asked:
I.  What's the overall sales trend?<br>
II. What are the Top 5 products by sales?<br>
III.What are the most selling products?<br>
IV. What is the most preferred shipmode?<br>
V.  What are the most profitable category and subcategory?<br>

In the quest of answering the above business questions I implore different pandas & matplotlib methods.<br>
They include:<br>
1.  Checked the Time period of the Data Frame<br>
2.  Adding columns<br>
3.  Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)<br>
4.  Using the .apply() method<br>
5.  Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis<br>
6.  Plotting bar charts and trend graph to visualize our results<br>
7.  Labeling our graphs<br>
